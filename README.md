## Assignment Description

Using the gapminder.csv data create a scatter plot of fertility (x axis) vs life expectancy (y axis). Include only data from the year 1980.  When a user hovers over a point on the scatter plot, in the tooltip show a line graph of time (x axis) vs population (y axis) for that country associated with the hovered over point.

Tableau uses a complicated algorithm to determine what points get labels. You do not have to match the labels on the Tableau viz. However, you should add a label of the country name for every country that has a population of over 100 million people. Put this label 20px to the right of the center of the point.

You don't have to include a filter by year or a legend showing population size.
